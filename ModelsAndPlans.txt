Inputs of the neural net

Unit attributes (health, range, damage)

5 most relevant enemy attributes 
	(5 units chosen by heuristic; prioritize considering units that attacked it in last 3 seconds, and then by distance)
	-> And their positions (by angle from unit and distance)
	
5 most relevant ally attributes
	(choose by distance only)
	
Reward and punishment:
 Every time something dies, give reward/punishment based on (enemy kills so far vs. allies died so far)
